## Credits

_Karma_ is inspired by a mix of [Ayu](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=teabyii.ayu), Lucy and [Andromeda](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EliverLara.andromeda) themes. In addition, while starting work on the v3 release and on the lookout for a way to generate complimentary themes with tokens, I took heavy inspiration from [GitHub's VS Code themes](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme).

## Overrides

To override this theme in your personal config file, please follow the guide in the [VS Code color theme documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme). You could do something like this:

```json
// settings.json
{
	"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
		// So that this change is only for the Karma theme
		"[Karma]": {
			"editorLineNumber.foreground": "#333333"
		}
	}
},
```
